i think instead of making a webapp, a command line tool will be much effective
here it will do the workflow
1. there will be a input.txt where there will be passwords
2. key value pair like GEMINI_API_CODE = "sk -***" and such
3. the user will do command line like make_vault file1.txt , it can be multiple or single file
4.while making a vault, the system will give me a SSH key, public private in a file
5. after that a file will be generated in the project root, where if i want to visit it in VSCODE, i click to the file, like gen1.vault there will be an interface, mentioning what keys are there visually, but wont show the 
value
6. i can call from the file like gen1.get('openai_key') or sth like, .env file
7. i cant print or see the keys,
8.Added implementation : i can implement rate limiter for the each api,maybe fine grain control to each api keys or overall as a whole 
9. make a DASHBOARD about the files, which files are used how many times, which API's are used how many times and all
rate limiter can be controlled from there, can block any file,modify,add any environment variables.
